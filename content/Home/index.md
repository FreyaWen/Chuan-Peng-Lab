**Metascience**  
Metascience (also known as meta-research) is the use of scientific methodology to study science itself. Metascience seeks to increase the quality of scientific research while reducing inefficiency. It is also known as "research on research" and "the science of science", as it uses research methods to study how research is done and find where improvements can be made.

**Modeling**  
A model is an informative representation of an object, person or system. The term originally denoted the plans of a building in late 16th-century English, and derived via French and Italian ultimately from Latin modulus, a measure. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model)

We are located in the school of psychology of Nanjing Normal University, where Mr. Hu chuanpeng works, Our members are distributed all over the world.

We look forward to doctoral students, postdoctors, masters and undergraduates who are interested in this field to join our team, and welcome to apply for Nanjing Normal University
